### Hello, world!
#### :slightly_smiling_face: Who am I 
My name is Ilia. 4 years ago I got enrolled into Project Management degree program, however during some time I realised that I have a passion for Information Technologies and everything related to working with data. That's how I've started developing myself in these fields.

This GitHub serves as a kindly reminder for myself to continue developing my skills, gaining new knowledge and also as a personal portfolio for my data-related projects.

Right now I'm working at Russian company SberMegaMarket, which is a part of Sber ecosystem (largest bank in Russian Federation) as a Junior Data Analyst. I'm passionate about Data Science and Artificial Intellengence and try to gain as many knowledge and experience as a Data Scietist. I write in Python, using Jupyter notebooks and sometimes Pycharm.
