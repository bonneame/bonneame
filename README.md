### Hello, world!
#### :slightly_smiling_face: Who am I 
My name is Ilia. In 2018 I got enrolled into Project Management degree program, however during some time I realised that I have a passion for Information Technologies and everything related to working with data. That's how I've started developing myself in these fields.

Right now I am working as Analytics Team Lead at Sravni.ru, being responsible for 5 product streams:
- Agency Cabinet
- KASKO
- Mortgage Insurance / Travel Insurance / Accident Insurance / Property Insurance
- Deposits For Individuals
- Business Products

I'm passionate about Data, Artificial Intellengence, Analytics, Hypothesis Testing and Machine Learning. I write in Python and SQL, use Superset as my core BI tool and am planning to learn Scala one day.
